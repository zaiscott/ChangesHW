   <p>
      The differences between chapters 7 and 8 is that while 7 talks about the mean, median, mode, and range of data; chapter 8 deals with the trends of data that is collected over time.

            <ul>
                <li>Pros</li>
                <ul>
                    <li> has the ability to show unseen or hidden data from before. </li>
                      
                </ul>
                <li>Cons</li>
                <ul>
                    <li> Alot of math is required to be done properly</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <li> Indexing</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Pros</li>
                <ul>
                    <li> when looking at the data, one may be able to see and understand the data more clearly than a data set without such indexing.</li>
            
                </ul>
                <li>Cons</li>
                <ul>
                    <li> similar to log transformations, this requires alot of math to be done correctily, and as computer scientist we are very lazy.   XD</li>

            <li> Seasonal subseries chart </li>
            <ul>
                <li>Pros</li>
                <ul>
                    <li> you are able to see different types of data at the same time</li>
                    <li> due to the fact of being able to see differnt data sets, it is easier to compare the data agaisnt one anaother</li>

                <li>Cons</li>
                <ul>
                    <li> if done lazely or not effort put in it, it will not be visually pleasing  or possibly not functional.</li>
